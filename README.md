# PlexFileManagementScripts
A collection of scripts to help manage my Plex files

## PlexMoveMovies.py
This script takes any .m4v or .mp4 file, creates a new directory using the files name, and moves that file into it's new directory.

*example:*

`C:/Movies/Lucky Number Slevin (2006) {imdb-tt0425210}.m4v` 

would become

`C:/Movies/Lucky Number Slevin (2006) {imdb-tt0425210}/Lucky Number Slevin (2006) {imdb-tt0425210}.m4v`
